# heuristic-version
Utility classes that help parse and compare version strings

This is a flexible wrapper class that can take version strings of multiple styles and perform reasonable comparisons between them when possible. I will also be adapting the code to handle various version range styles.

The code is a massive hack, but it seems to do the trick.

I make use of jsemver where possible (https://github.com/zafarkhaja/jsemver)
